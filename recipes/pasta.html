      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>It's super easy to make but tastes like so much effort went into it. </p>
  

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>16 ounces rigatoni pasta or penne</li>
         <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon fresh garlic finely minced</li>
         <li>2/3 cup tomato paste</li>
         <li>1 1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes or to taste</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
         <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
         <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan more to taste</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
         <li>pasta water</li>
         <li>optional garnishes: finely chopped parsley and red pepper flakes</li>
      </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Throw in the pasta and cook according to package directions. Reserve at least 1 cup of pasta water and then drain.</li>
         <li>In a saucepan, add the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes. The tomato paste will darken in color from a bright red to reddish brown. This process removes acidity from the tomato paste.</li>
         <li>Add heavy cream and mix until incorporated. Simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
         <li>Add the red pepper flakes, dried basil, salt, and black pepper to taste. Mix again.</li>
         <li>Add the grated parmesan, butter, and 1/2 a cup pasta water. Mix until the sauce is smooth and creamy. If you think it needs more pasta water, you can add but 1/2 a cup is perfect for me.</li>
         <li>Toss in the cooked pasta and mix to coat evenly. Optional, top it off with more grated parm, chopped parsley, and chili flakes.</li>
      </ol>
